## Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) for semantic segmentation of water hyacinth images. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, allowing for detailed understanding of the objects present.

## Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset specifically curated for water hyacinth segmentation tasks. The dataset includes annotated images where each pixel is labeled as either water hyacinth or background.

## Model Architecture:
PSPNet is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture designed for semantic segmentation. It incorporates a pyramid pooling module to capture global context information at different scales, enhancing the segmentation accuracy.

## Usage:
Training: Use the provided scripts to train the PSPNet model on your dataset. Adjust the hyperparameters as necessary for optimal performance.
Inference: After training, the model can be used for inference on new images to segment water hyacinth regions.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) or Pixel Accuracy.
## Requirements:
- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.6)
- torchvision (>=0.7)
